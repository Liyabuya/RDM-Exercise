Analysis of Covid-19 deaths between 2020 and 2021 in different countries.
Steps I carried in creating the above graph: 
1.	I used dataset from:  https://www.kaggle.com/alexzixinhan/yelp-covid19-features
2.	Inserted a pivot table and filtered by country, year and total number of deaths between 2020- 2021.
3.	I find that the total number of deaths in different countries increased from last year.  
4.	The United States Covid deaths toll is higher this year and this could be due to not enough people vaccinated.
